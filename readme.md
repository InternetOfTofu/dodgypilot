**Welcome to dodgypilot**

This is an extremely dodgy (No FCW and driver can press accelerator) fork of openpilot, optimized for a TSS-P Prius with pedal, use with extreme caution.

You should use this fork if you are looking forward to getting banned.

Features (Toyotas only):
1. No sound (Not yet complete, car chimes on disengage, this can be fixed if op does not send pcm_cancel command)(Two small chimes from the dash when OP wants your attention).
2. No FCW (FCW handled by Driver Support ECU + SDSU).
3. Includes shamelessly ripped off but modified version of @ShaneSmiskol 's comma pedal SnG smoothing code (Extremely smooth stop and go, almost no double braking, capable of very low speed ACC with no jerking).
4. Includes shamelessly ripped off but modified version of dragonpilot's "cruise speed override" function.
5. Less acceleration for more eco driving.
6. Allows hard braking (can stop in time for a stopped car when travelling at 80 km/h).
7. (Hopefully) no uploading.
8. Allows driver to use the accelerator.
9. Brake disc icon shamelessly copied from @kegman
